 * Description:
 * The Jones family has set up the tent on a camping site. Itâ€™s hot and
 * for the kids they want to fill a bath with water. Father has two 
 * jerrycans, each having a volume of 12 litres. He is strong enough to 
 * walk with the jerrycans to the nearest water tap and carry them back 
 * completely filled.
 * 
 * This is a program that asks how many litres of water is needed to 
 * fill the bath. It assume that this number is an integer. The program 
 * must print how often Dad must walk up and down to fill the bath.
